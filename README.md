# Ola Data Analytics End to End Project 

## About
The Ola Project analyzes ride-hailing data using SQL for querying large datasets, Excel for data manipulation and cleanup, and Power BI for creating interactive reports and dashboards.

This project is divided into the following sections:
- **Data Extraction**: SQL queries are used to extract relevant data from databases (such as ride details, user information, etc.).
- **Data Cleaning**: Excel is used to clean and format the data before analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Power BI is used to create insightful reports and dashboards for better business decision-making.

The goal is to understand trends, customer behavior, and operational patterns, such as peak hours, ride distribution, and customer demographics.
